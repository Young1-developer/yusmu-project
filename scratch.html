                    <h2>(1) What is scratch programming</h2>
                   <p>Scratch is a visual programming language designed to teach children (and beginners) how to code. It uses a drag-and-drop interface where users can select blocks of code and stack them together to create programs. Scratch was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab, and it has become a popular tool for introducing programming concepts to young learners.

                    Scratch programming allows users to create interactive stories, games, and animations, as well as to share their projects with others on the Scratch website. Scratch also provides a community where users can collaborate with others and learn from their peers. Since its release in 2007, Scratch has been translated into more than 70 languages and used by millions of people worldwide.</p>

                    <h3>(2) Why you should become a scratcher</h3>
                    <p>There are several reasons why you might want to become a "Scratcher," or someone who uses Scratch to create projects and share them with the community. Here are a few:</p>
                    <p>(a) Learn coding skills: Scratch is a great way to learn the fundamentals of coding, including logic, sequencing, and problem-solving. The visual nature of Scratch makes it easy for beginners to understand the basics of coding without getting bogged down in syntax and technical details</p>
                    <p>(b) Express creativity: With Scratch, you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations. Scratch provides a wide range of tools and resources that allow you to bring your ideas to life in a fun and engaging way</p>
                    <p>(c) Join a community: Scratch has a large and active community of users who share their projects, offer feedback, and collaborate with one another. By becoming a Scratch user, you can connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about coding and creativity.</p>
                    <p>(d) Improve collaboration and communication skills: Sharing your Scratch projects with others and collaborating with other Scratch users can help you improve your communication and collaboration skills. You can also learn from others and get feedback on your projects, which can help you improve your coding and creative skills.</p>
                    <p>(e) Have fun: Finally, Scratch is just plain fun! It's a great way to spend your free time, express your creativity, and learn new skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, Scratch has something to offer.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cyber-content">
                    <h3>(3) How much you can get as a scratcher</h3>
                  <p>As a "Scratcher" who uses Scratch to create projects and share them with the community, you cannot earn money directly from the Scratch website or platform. Scratch is a free educational tool designed for learning and creativity, and the main goal of the Scratch community is to provide a supportive environment for users to learn and share their work.</p>
                  <p>However, there are ways to monetize your Scratch projects outside of the Scratch platform. For example, you could create a game or animation using Scratch and then export it to another platform like HTML5 or Unity. From there, you could potentially sell your game or animation on a marketplace or platform that allows for the sale of digital products. Keep in mind that this would require additional skills beyond just using Scratch, such as marketing and business development.</p>
                  <p>Overall, while you can't earn money directly from Scratch, it is still a valuable tool for learning and creativity, and can potentially lead to other opportunities down the line.</p>

                    <h3>(4) How to start learning scratch</h3>
                <p>Scratch is a visual programming language designed to help beginners learn the basics of coding. Here are some steps to get started with Scratch:</p>
                <p>(a) Create an account: To use Scratch, you need to create an account on the Scratch website.</p>
                <p>(b) Explore the Scratch interface: Once you have created an account, take some time to explore the Scratch interface. Scratch is based on a drag-and-drop system, so you will need to learn how to navigate the different menus and blocks.</p>
                <p>(c) Complete tutorials: Scratch offers a range of tutorials that are designed to help you learn how to use the platform. You can start with the Getting Started tutorial, which provides an overview of the platform and its features.</p>
                <p>(d) Create projects: Once you have completed the tutorials, start creating your own projects. You can start with simple projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.</p>
                <p>(e) Share your projects: Scratch has a large community of users who share their projects on the platform. Consider sharing your own projects and getting feedback from other users.</p>
                <p>(f) Keep learning: As you become more comfortable with Scratch, consider exploring more advanced features and programming concepts. There are many resources available online to help you continue your learning journey.</p>
                <p>Overall, learning Scratch can be a fun and rewarding experience. By following these steps, you can start creating your own interactive games, animations, and stories in no time.</p>
