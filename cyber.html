                <p>(a) Firewall: A firewall is a network security tool that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>
                <p>(b) Antivirus software: Antivirus software is designed to detect and remove computer viruses and other malicious software from a system.</p>
                <p>(c) Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS): IDPS are tools that monitor network traffic for signs of potential attacks and can automatically block or alert on suspicious activity.</p>
                <p>(d) Vulnerability scanners: Vulnerability scanners are tools used to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a system or network that could be exploited by attackers.</p>
                <p>(e) Security information and event management (SIEM) systems: SIEM systems are designed to collect and analyze security-related data from various sources in real-time to provide visibility into potential threats.</p>
                <p>(f) Virtual private network (VPN): A VPN is a secure connection between two or more devices over the internet, which is often used to protect data transmission.</p>
                <p>(g) Password managers: Password managers are tools used to securely store and manage passwords, reducing the risk of password-related attacks.</p>
                <p>(h) Encryption software: Encryption software is used to protect sensitive data by converting it into a coded language that can only be deciphered by authorized users.</p>
                <p>(i) Data backup and recovery software: Backup and recovery software is used to create backups of critical data and restore it in the event of a cyber attack or other data loss event.</p>
